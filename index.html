    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>
      This is just my way of keeping track of the posts I've made on Tumblr. If
      you're here from that, it's nice to meet you!

      <h3>What is this blog?  + Disclaimer  </h3>
      <h4> 1/2/23 </h4>
      <p> Hello! I'm writing this blog as a way to chronicle my exploration of pain management. I'm no psychologist or doctor, just a programmer who reads a lot of psychology books and is trying to make sense of life with chronic pain.  I often focus on Acceptance and Commitment  Therapy (ACT), but I'll also be reading philosophy books and looking into how different cultures handle pain and what stories society creates about it.  
        <br />
        I chose this name because I often read fairy tale stories growing up where there's a magical, mysterious hag in woods.  She would be pruning her herbs or taking care of some little woodland creature just to find the worn out hero/heroine on their journey passed out on her back porch.  If she's a proper marsh hag, she'd cook them a bowl of soup and help send them on their way in the right direction.  I love the idea of someday being a hag or merlin archetype like that. (Or Aizawa for my fellow MHA fans.) 
        <br />
        But for now, I'm just a wide-eyed adventurer myself.  Anything that I share is just my own attempts at making sense of information I'm reading and is not to be taken at face value without your looking into it yourself. Or your doctor or family member looking into it first.
        <br />
        I hope you have a good day! Thank you for reading and for being a part of my adventuring party if you choose to do so.
